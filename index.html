					<h5 class="subtitled">Veru &amp; his place in the world</h5><br><br>
					<p>
						“I paint to explore the power of hands, the destruction of the ego, and the beauty of the mind, in order to reveal the light of a universal soul." – Veru Narula <br><br>

						Whether I am creating a bridge from East to West, from the scientific to the arts, from the abstract to the representational, from the oil painting to the digital, my art and paintings serve as a bridge of ideas. I often work in reaction to the events or concepts of an ever converging global landscape. Much like an author, I like to create a visual plotline for my subject matter that tells a story that couldn’t be bridged in other forms. As one type of bridge, my paintings are visual representations that draw from international conflicts and that of literature. I inspired by the allegory of an ancient text or a classic work of Shakespeare and make the bridge to a current conflict, such as Iranian diplomacy or Russian government succession planning.
						Additionally, I have a key interest in the contrast of both the abstract and the representational. Found in works called “Strip of Life Art”, I am inviting the viewer to participate in telling their narrative, and together, creating a personalized work of art.  The photography that contrasts with abstract works elements from nature.
						Lastly, I am interested in the tension between the historic past of the oil medium itself.  What is the role of the oil painting in a fast paced digital imagery rotation of today’s 21st century? To react to this, in some works I have constructed customized “donut” canvas, and embedded oil paintings with LCD screens. The digital video display questions the role of whether a painting can, indeed, be plugged in? In my studio process, my bridge or juxtaposition ranges in imagery, ideas and technology, but reflect my intellectual interests in contemporary art, including social art, authorship and the global market.
					</p>
					<h5 class="subtitled">Social Art &amp; Its Discontent</h5><br><br>
					<p>
						“All artists are all alike. They dream of doing something that’s more social, more collaborative, and more real than art.” – Dan Graham.<br><br>

						I’m highly interested in how the social turn in contemporary art has prompted an ethical turn in art criticism. Claire Bishop brought to light a paradox I grapple with as an artist on process over product. I will be judged on how “successful” my collaboration is, with keen attention to how I fully represent the subjects. Yet in social subcultures, I’m aware that any hint of potential exploitation of the subjects will signal that the ends justified the means, and my process has been compromised. A good example where I have encountered issues of social art was with a painting of mine entitled “Kathak Dancers”, which was on display at the Hammond Museum. My intention for painting was to tell a story of triumph in survivorship. I interviewed many subjects who had overcome great adversities throughout the world. I eventually painted 3 dancers who were prepared to perform in front of a temple. There was a gas explosion, caused by either an environmental disaster or a terrorist act. In spite of the conditions, the dancers decided to put on gasmasks and perform anyways. Naturally as an artist felt I was I captured the “essential truth” of my process, but how was the work received by the public? Interestingly, the work got a good amount of press coverage, including a write up by then New York Times writer Benjamin Genoccio. He wrote “Kathak Dancers is stealthily political. It is an oil painting of a group of three dancers performing against a surreal-looking landscape with a fiery red sky. Kathak is a classical dance from northern India and also the national dance of Pakistan. The link with Pakistan here is significant, for the dancers all wear gas masks. I read this painting as an allegory for the threat of war between the two countries, both of them now nuclear powers." After the write up, one must question was the social truth in this work?

					</p>
					<h5 class="subtitled">Authorship &amp; Postproduction</h5> <br><br>
					<p>
						I’m interested in the contemporary issue of authorship and postproduction, a term from the audiovisual vocabulary used in television, film, and video that refers to the set of processes applied to recorded material. In a series I work on in which I take abstract oil paintings with mixed media, I utilize black and white photo montages that I am able to secure the rights to or take myself. In this new work, where does the role of authorship fit? <br>

						Nicolas Bourriaud wrote that since the early nineties, an ever increasing number of artworks have been created on the basis of preexisting works; more and more artists interpret, reproduce, re-exhibit, or use works made by others or available cultural products. This art of postproduction seems to respond to the proliferating chaos of global culture in the information age, which is characterized by an increase in the supply of works and the art world's assimilation of previously ignored forms. Artists who insert their own work into that of others contribute to the eradication of the traditional distinction between production and consumption, creation and copy, readymade and original work. The material they manipulate is no longer primary. Citing one of Bourriaud’s examples, at the 1993 Venice Biennale, Angela Bulloch exhibited a video of Solaris, the science fiction film by Andrei Tarkovsky, replacing its sound track with her own dialogue.
						It is no longer a matter of elaborating a form on the basis of a raw material but working with objects that are already in circulation on the cultural market. As I expand my own art and series, I’m interested in this intellectual aspects of objects already informed by other objects.
					</p>
					<h5 class="subtitled">Artist as a Global Entrepreneur</h5><br><br>
					<p>
						I definitely have a strong and unapologetic interest in the artist as a global entrepreneur. One of the most interesting forms of critical theory comes from Hal Foster, who asserts that the Medium is, indeed, the Market. In The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, Warhol showcased that not only was it OK for artists to make as much money as possible, but ‘making money is art’ and ‘good business is the best art.’ After establishing Warhol Enterprises in 1957, his films, Interview magazine, books and TV programs were part of his global empire, and today ‘good business’ contemporary art standards are set by Hirst. Building on the 80s, in which Koons would ambiguously conveyed the art exhibition and commodity display. Amy Cappellao, head of contemporary art at Christie’s, wrote that the new type of collector understands art as an asset one can borrow against or trade on and defer capital on, and regards the art market as a securities market. Art’s recent financial appeal stems from the idea that high quality works would increase and could trade among individuals globally. In my art work, I am working on a series I’d like to further in the ISP that explores the relationship between the traditional oil painting and the digital display, which naturally could have very strong commercial outputs. Will I question the role of the global appeal, and the fact that an audience may range from Argentina to Singapore? I think the global market and readiness is a key conceptual issue to face.
					</p>

					<h5 class="subtitled">Educational Experience</h5><br><br>
					<p>
						I was trained in a variety of disciplines. I studied Engineering at Columbia University as an undergraduate, and did a discipline in fine arts. I then furthered my training at the School of Visual Arts. I also took critical writing classes which led to the publication of my first novel, The Vital Breath. Along the way, I also took critical contemporary classes at the Museum of Modern Art. In my own studio art practice, I continue to make and produce works that challenge my interest and esthetic outlook on the world.
